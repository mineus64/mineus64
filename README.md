Hi! I'm HP8, a young programmer from the Best Coast! I use this GitHub to put up various snippets and projects from time to time, which I may or may not update. I'm currently freelancing as a game developer while I teach myself how to code. Most of what I put up on GitHub are tools for Unity, little bits of code I find myself repeating across projects that might be useful in the future. You're free and welcome to use any of them to your heart's content, please just credit me if and when you do so.

## Language Familiarity

### C#

I'm decently familiar with C# and use it on a regular basis!

**6/10**

### Python

I have a passing familiarity with Python. I used to use it a lot but now I only use it for small tools and the like.

**3/10**

### JavaScript

It's similar enough to C# that I think I could pick it up if I needed to.

**1/10**
