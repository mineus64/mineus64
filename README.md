Hi! I'm HP8, a young programmer from the Best Coast! I use this GitHub to put up various snippets and projects from time to time, which I may or may not update. I'm currently freelancing as a game developer while I teach myself how to code.

## Language Familiarity

### C#

I'm decently familiar with C# and use it on a regular basis!

**6/10**

### Python

I have a passing familiarity with Python. I used to use it a lot but now I only use it for small tools and the like.

**3/10**

### JavaScript

It's similar enough to C# that I think I could pick it up if I needed to.
